Everything should be fully written in Typescript and be fully typesafe. There should be an NPM script to typecheck the codebase which should always pass.
This app shouldn’t have any backend, it should be client only.
Use the latest version of React.
Use Vite as the app bundler. This app will only ever run locally, so no need for a stage or production configuration or scripts.
